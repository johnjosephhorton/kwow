{\footnotesize \emph{Notes:}
           The sample for both regressions reported in this table are all the repsponses where the respondent said they knew what an occupation consisted of.
In Column~(1), the dependent variable is the actual log mean wage for that occupation (from the May 2013 OES estimates from the BLS), while in Column~(2) the dependent variable is an index for whether the BLS predicts that by 2020 the fraction employed in that occupation will grow by more than 5\% (outcome = 1), fall by more than 5\% (outcome = -1) or will not change by more than 5\%, positive or negative (outcome = 0).
The important independent variable in both regressions is the respondent's prediction.
Both regressions include a respondent-specific standard error. 
Standard errors are clustered at the level of the individual respondent.
