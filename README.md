So the DGP for this project is a simple survey I'm conducting on Mechanical Turk. Here's a link to the HTML i'm using to collect data:

https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/420874/survey.html

The ${Title} parameter is populated with a list of the 100 most common occupations in the US. Each occupation is done by 30 different workers. I have data from the actual statistical agencies on employment, wages, wage trends etc.---I want to compare the MTurk answers to the official statistical numbers.

Basically what I'm looking for is someone to plot & summarize the data in interesting & informative ways. I can do this myself---I'd say I'm a ggplot2 expert---and an experienced R programmer---but I'm looking to get help. I'm looking for someone who likes hacking around and exploring---I don't want someone who I need to tell what to do every 5 minutes. I'm very comfortable with letting someone explore and play around with minimal guidance from me (I always give 5 star feedback regardless, so don't worry about that).

So how does this sound? I'll hire you then share repos with the code I have so far and the datasets. What's your github?

Great - so added you to the repository and made some commit messages w/ data files. I like to keep all my R code in /code/R/ and data in /data. Analysis should go in /writeup.  Dump plots in /writeup/plots and any LaTeX tables in /writeup/tables (though don't worry too much about that now---just get used to the data). 

Do you want a code sample for parsing MTurk output data? It should be relatively straightforward but if you hit any snags, let me  know. 

Also - you can email at john.joseph.horton@gmail.com.
